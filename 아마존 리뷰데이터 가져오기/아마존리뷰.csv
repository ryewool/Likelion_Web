Rebel M.,2,"January 17, 2019","I am very angry about this product. It advertises ""coconut mct oil"" on the front of the box, so it leads you to believe it's 100% coconut mct oil. However, it is not made with 100% coconut mct oil, but a blend of coconut and palm oils! I am flaming angry about this as I am anti-palm oils due to the clear cutting of forests to grow the palm trees and the false ""sustainably produced"" sources. Slim Fast really needs to correct the false print with stating coconut and palm mct oil blend. But then they are likely to not sale as much. I will not buy these again!"
Janice Dysinger,3,"December 14, 2018",This is an awesome fat bomb! BUT was surprised to find it at Walmart for under $10 for the same quantity box.
GG,1,"January 13, 2019","No offense to those who gave five stars -- but these are GROSS. If you are trying to find a keto way to replicate Justin's PB cups (my cup of choice)...keep looking. These are so so so very not good. The ""chocolate"" to ""peanut butter"" ratio is way off, the texture defies all rules of nature is somehow dry/crumbly and oily at the same time, and don't even get me started on the aftertaste. Blegh. Knew I was taking a chance on these, but please learn from my mistake and order some choc zero, a Lily's bar, or basically anything other than this product to keep your sweet tooth at bay."
Joshua jones,1,"December 16, 2019",These knocked me right out of ketosis. the first time i took a keto test strip and had negative readings just by eating two that day. Made my nose bleed and taste like expired ressess. Midas well eat reqular reesees if youre gonna trying to stay in ketosis buying this stuff.
Shopaholic ,1,"March 17, 2019",These knocked me right about of ketosis. I‚Äôve also heard that they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúketo approved‚Äù. Save your money and your progress!!
Sarah S.,4,"December 10, 2018","Oh. My. Gosh. These are amazing. If you‚Äôre expecting them to taste like Reese‚Äôs, you‚Äôll be disappointed, but the flavor is excellent. I was worried because a lot of Keto snacks have a really odd, slightly horrible, artificial aftertaste and these do not whatsoever. If you‚Äôre worried, no need to be! I only gave it a 4-star because of the price. For something that could easily disappear from my shelf in a weekend, it‚Äôs insanely expensive.Additionally, these contain Erythritol, a sugar alcohol. These are not easily absorbed by the body so although they are considered a type of carb, you subtract them from the total number of carbs.6g carbs - 3g fiber - 2g Erythritol= 1g net carbs.No need to feel guilty eating these suckers....unless you eat them all in one sitting."

Andrea Oilar,1,"March 30, 2019","The box was damaged and obviously exposed to too much heat as all of them were melted deformed clumps. One of the packets was open, smearing chocolate inside the box and onto other packets.  Way too much money wasted on this damaged product!!!"
Metamorph,5,"April 19, 2021","If you‚Äôre tired of all of the chocolate & peanut butter flavored products and you love lemon then you will most likely love these.Dear SlimFast,I‚Äôm sure you know how much the public loves your lemon fat bombs! They are the one product you really outdid yourself with! I have a suggestion. Using the same formula, make a key lime pie and an orange creamsicle fat bomb! I‚Äôm sure they will be a big hit like the lemon! Please mark my comment as helpful so we can see how many folks like this idea! These are constantly sold out from a lot of major retailers as us fans know.üòâ"
Pat Fehlman,2,"January 15, 2019","Was very excited to get these because I had heard rave reviews on them. They are very small but very good.

Verified Customer ‚àö,3,"February 8, 2019","Ok but extremely expensive for 1 box. I ordered and was $22, when it arrived I thought more than 1 box would arrive. But no. Then at Walmart last night, they sold the exact same thing $4.95 for a box. Bought a few from them. Its 100% the same.So beware that for $22, you'll get 1 box not a case, there are 14 small pieces in the box. They are about the size for a quarter.The taste is okay."
Jeff's Cave,1,"February 22, 2021",It‚Äôs not keto at all and the ingredients are just a list of poisons. This entire line of products is garbage for keto. Deceptive at best and cheating people of there money for sure.Here is some science you can‚Äôt stay in keto if you eat this candy.It gives you the drunkest farts and some weird pastie poop.Try it write your own review.

Kreature,5,"April 1, 2020","Wow.  I had tempered my expectations based on some of the reviews.  Over the last 20+ years I've grown used to eating all kinds of supplements and diet foods and wholly understand that these kinds of foods are going to be a bit ""off"" and not taste like the ""real thing"".  These Peanut Butter Cups were surprisingly as close to the real thing as anything I've ever tried.  It satisfied my urge for a sweet tasting snack, and gave me that little boost of energy.  I imagine the people whining about the taste of this product are the same people you'd see on TLC's My 600-Pound Life.  They suck at living and have grown completely out of touch with reality.

Very high on my list to always have on hand at home. I've been purchasing these fat bombs since they came out. They are all Terrific!! Coupons once in a while would be nice though!!"
RUI S.,1,"January 8, 2019","bought 3 boxes, 2 boxes being opened before. Until I saw few bags are open and seems like somebody took a bite and put it back in the box...... disgusting"
CHRISTINE BURKE,1,"October 5, 2019",Received these today. Every single one prob melted and are half flattened. Box was squashed at bottom. Will never buy again.
Jbjbjbjb45,5,"November 13, 2018",These have great macros and clean ingredients. I highly recommend them for a small treat on the keto diet. Delicious!!
Canadian Girl,5,"December 7, 2018","Okay, I have to stop buying because I eat several at once!  THESE ARE AMAZING!  I keep them in the freezer and throw a couple in my lunch bag each day!  HOLY COW!  YUM!"
Verified Customer ‚àö,3,"February 8, 2019","Ok but extremely expensive for 1 box. I ordered and was $22, when it arrived I thought more than 1 box would arrive. But no. Then at Walmart last night, they sold the exact same thing $4.95 for a box. Bought a few from them. Its 100% the same.So beware that for $22, you'll get 1 box not a case, there are 14 small pieces in the box. They are about the size for a quarter.The taste is okay."
Jeff's Cave,1,"February 22, 2021",It‚Äôs not keto at all and the ingredients are just a list of poisons. This entire line of products is garbage for keto. Deceptive at best and cheating people of there money for sure.Here is some science you can‚Äôt stay in keto if you eat this candy.It gives you the drunkest farts and some weird pastie poop.Try it write your own review. I bought a bunch and gave it to someone at work I don‚Äôt like.
Kreature,5,"April 1, 2020","Wow.  I had tempered my expectations based on some of the reviews.  Over the last 20+ years I've grown used to eating all kinds of supplements and diet foods and wholly understand that these kinds of foods are going to be a bit ""off"" and not taste like the ""real thing"".  These Peanut Butter Cups were surprisingly as close to the real thing as anything I've ever tried.  It satisfied my urge for a sweet tasting snack, and gave me that little boost of energy.  I imagine the people whining about the taste of this product are the same people you'd see on TLC's My 600-Pound Life.  They suck at living and have grown completely out of touch with reality.  If you are serious about Keto, and you want to add a little diversity to your diet, buy these!"
Corina Krautheim,1,"December 11, 2018",I think the taste is awful .. Would not buy again
Rebecca Goodman,1,"April 1, 2019","There isn't an option for NO stars, but this should be NO STARS.I received this today and the box was taped shut - my first instinct that something was wrong.

Adam in the SF Bay Area,1,"January 17, 2021","Let me get the serious bit out of the way first:  These are awful.  I mean, seriously, horribly, terribly bad in every way. Imagine you took some cardboard, stepped on it, left it out in the rain for 42 days, stuck it in your blender, made ""peanut butter cups"" from it by sprinkling 2 drops of peanut oil and 1/100th of a teaspoon of cocoa powder on each ""cup.""  Then imagine something even more flavorless and with even more off-putting mouth feel.Yes, after trying to force two pieces of this down, I threw out the box and then chanted a protective spell over my trashbin so that the Devil himself would not become reconstituted in my home, bringing about the end of the world as we know it.  HA!  Who am I kidding?  I bet this would give even the Devil uncomfortable stomach rumblings and cause him to run fleeing towards the nearest 7-Eleven to cleanse his palate.Okay, with that out of the way, let me list what I'd rather do than eat another one of these:- Sriracha sauce... in my eyes.- Talk therapy with my best friend's evil mother in law.- Baby Shark song blasted into my ears 24/7You've been warned.Oh, almost forgot!  What's the silver lining?!- Eating one of these may cause you to lose your appetite and thus -- at least temporarily -- eat less.- You can use this product as a VERY powerful threat with your kids.

Marijo,2,"May 10, 2020","Yes, this is the caramel nut cluster. No matter what I did, I could not get anything except the peanut butter cup to reivew although I bought the caramel nut cluster. This caramel nut cluster tastes good and has a really  good chewy bite that meets my cravings, but...it comes smashed and stuck to the paper, or the chocolate is a chalky and discolored. It looks like maybe it has been overheated and cooled several times maybe...but not where I live in the Northwest. So for an expensive product, this should look like Godiva...but it looks like something only a desperate dieter would eat.I hope it gets fixed. I really am not going to spend this kind of money until it is."
LAS ,4,"January 25, 2021",I had ordered these fat bombs cause I wasn't taking un all the fat I needed on keto and I have to say they are so delicious. Reason for 4 stars is cause I scanned the barcode and it says its 4g of nc not 2 so im a bit confused on that it did confuse me a bit because it was the boxes code I scanned and the info came up doffeent than what the box says other than I love these. Its hard to have just one.The amount that are in the box is a really good amount this box should last me a while.
Michelle S,5,"December 16, 2018","I honestly didn‚Äôt expect these to be sooooo good. I really think they are one of the best keto treats I have tried. They smell just like a Reese‚Äôs, the chocolate texture is spot on and the peanut butter filling is more creamy and not crumbly also a huge plus is I can read all the ingredients.  Will be buying more to stay stocked up in my fridge!"
JEllenAll,1,"March 22, 2019","So, this is keto. Other slim fast products are not. HOWEVER, these give me so much intestinal distress, it is not worth it for me. I‚Äôll make my own fat bombs from now on. Not to mention they are expensive for what they are!"
S. M. Baker,1,"October 11, 2020","I've bought these before and they've been good, but this last shipment with so thoroughly melted that these are not even recognizable. The chocolate had melted, had puddled inside the wrapper, and had then re-congealed back into a wrapper-shaped blob. I checked the local temperatures, and the local high was 71 degrees. I've received sweets on hotter days than this, so I suspect they didn't melt during the last mile delivery -- they probably melted weeks or months ago sitting in some warehouse. Based on flavor I would have given these 5 stars, but the presentation and the treatment of the product prior to arrival was so bad that it got knocked down to one star. If you are looking for Keto-friendly snacks, then I would recommend the Lily's brand, also sold here on Amazon, which seem to be well-cared for and even ship with cold packs."
FloridaChick,5,"February 4, 2020",I needed to loose 20lbs quick and Keto is my method.. unfortunately I love sweets..which is why I need to loose the weight.  When on Keto you eventually loose many of the cravings but I wanted a nice sweet treat every afternoon.  This has been perfect to satisfy and still allowed me to quickly loose the weight. I am testing every day with test strips and staying on track.  I am three weeks in and lost 15lbs.  I am only eating one of these a day and satisfies that sweet tooth.
Diva Lilo,5,"January 11, 2021",I love that they are individually wrapped. They really do taste good! It does curve my appetite for a couple of hours and great to satisfy my craving for chocolate.
Triavalon,2,"January 23, 2021","This review is for the strawberry cheesecake mini bars only. (Since I know Amazon likes to clump item reviews together)Other than the cream shots, I think I've more or less tried every product in the Slimfast Keto line and love or at least like all of it. One of these things is not like the others though. At first these bars are fine. It has a very clear, very strong strawberry cheesecake flavor. Not cheap version either, like white chocolate and generic berry. This tastes exactly like strawberry cheesecake.But once you start chewing, the experience changes, fast. I expected a texture similar to the other full size bars, chewy and crumbly and maybe a tiny bit too fatty, but something is horribly wrong with the base bar batter for these mini bars. The inside is fibery and chalky. Sandy even. The fat base dissolves and leaves behind a residue. Almost like big clumps of under-milled coconut fiber sticking together? Maybe it is the milk powder clumping up? IDK, it just felt like eating Metamucil. Even almost finishing writing this and having spat out half the piece, my mouth is still finding little grit particles.The flavor and the cream on the surface is fine, and really makes me wish this flavor had been in a fat bomb cup format instead (white chocolate cup with a berry cream inside), but the bar itself is disgusting.  I like the mini bar concept, but next time I hope they just make smaller versions of their existing meal bars instead of this."
aron,5,"April 28, 2020","for the people that said it knocked them out of ketosis. They don't know what they are talking about as long as you are low cards and no sugar it can't knock you out. I found the mint ones to be ""wow"" good!!. I've lost over 40lbs in the last 6 months and feel great. 10 lbs to go and don't miss eating bad stuff as long as I feel like I'm cheating on keto with help from these fat bombs. Try them. Its worth it."

This caramel nut cluster tastes good and has a really  good chewy bite that meets my cravings, but...it comes smashed and stuck to the paper, or the chocolate is a chalky and discolored. It looks like maybe it has been overheated and cooled several times maybe...but not where I live in the Northwest. So for an expensive product, this should look like Godiva...but it looks like something only a desperate dieter would eat.I hope it gets fixed. I really am not going to spend this kind of money until it is."
LAS ,4,"January 25, 2021",I had ordered these fat bombs cause I wasn't taking un all the fat I needed on keto and I have to say they are so delicious. Reason for 4 stars is cause I scanned the barcode and it says its 4g of nc not 2 so im a bit confused on that it did confuse me a bit because it was the boxes code I scanned and the info came up doffeent than what the box says other than I love these. Its hard to have just one.The amount that are in the box is a really good amount this box should last me a while.
Michelle S,5,"December 16, 2018","I honestly didn‚Äôt expect these to be sooooo good. I really think they are one of the best keto treats I have tried. They smell just like a Reese‚Äôs, the chocolate texture is spot on and the peanut butter filling is more creamy and not crumbly also a huge plus is I can read all the ingredients.  Will be buying more to stay stocked up in my fridge!"
JEllenAll,1,"March 22, 2019","So, this is keto. Other slim fast products are not. HOWEVER, these give me so much intestinal distress, it is not worth it for me. I‚Äôll make my own fat bombs from now on. Not to mention they are expensive for what they are!"
S. M. Baker,1,"October 11, 2020","I've bought these before and they've been good, but this last shipment with so thoroughly melted that these are not even recognizable. The chocolate had melted, had puddled inside the wrapper, and had then re-congealed back into a wrapper-shaped blob. I checked the local temperatures, and the local high was 71 degrees. I've received sweets on hotter days than this, so I suspect they didn't melt during the last mile delivery -- they probably melted weeks or months ago sitting in some warehouse. Based on flavor I would have given these 5 stars, but the presentation and the treatment of the product prior to arrival was so bad that it got knocked down to one star. If you are looking for Keto-friendly snacks, then I would recommend the Lily's brand, also sold here on Amazon, which seem to be well-cared for and even ship with cold packs."
FloridaChick,5,"February 4, 2020",I needed to loose 20lbs quick and Keto is my method.. unfortunately I love sweets..which is why I need to loose the weight.  When on Keto you eventually loose many of the cravings but I wanted a nice sweet treat every afternoon.  This has been perfect to satisfy and still allowed me to quickly loose the weight. I am testing every day with test strips and staying on track.  I am three weeks in and lost 15lbs.  I am only eating one of these a day and satisfies that sweet tooth.
Diva Lilo,5,"January 11, 2021",I love that they are individually wrapped. They really do taste good! It does curve my appetite for a couple of hours and great to satisfy my craving for chocolate.
Triavalon,2,"January 23, 2021","This review is for the strawberry cheesecake mini bars only. (Since I know Amazon likes to clump item reviews together)Other than the cream shots, I think I've more or less tried every product in the Slimfast Keto line and love or at least like all of it. One of these things is not like the others though. At first these bars are fine. It has a very clear, very strong strawberry cheesecake flavor. Not cheap version either, like white chocolate and generic berry. This tastes exactly like strawberry cheesecake.But once you start chewing, the experience changes, fast. I expected a texture similar to the other full size bars, chewy and crumbly and maybe a tiny bit too fatty, but something is horribly wrong with the base bar batter for these mini bars. The inside is fibery and chalky. Sandy even. The fat base dissolves and leaves behind a residue. Almost like big clumps of under-milled coconut fiber sticking together? Maybe it is the milk powder clumping up? IDK, it just felt like eating Metamucil. Even almost finishing writing this and having spat out half the piece, my mouth is still finding little grit particles.The flavor and the cream on the surface is fine, and really makes me wish this flavor had been in a fat bomb cup format instead (white chocolate cup with a berry cream inside), but the bar itself is disgusting.  I like the mini bar concept, but next time I hope they just make smaller versions of their existing meal bars instead of this."
aron,5,"April 28, 2020","for the people that said it knocked them out of ketosis. They don't know what they are talking about as long as you are low cards and no sugar it can't knock you out. I found the mint ones to be ""wow"" good!!. I've lost over 40lbs in the last 6 months and feel great. 10 lbs to go and don't miss eating bad stuff as long as I feel like I'm cheating on keto with help from these fat bombs. Try them. Its worth it."
Adam in the SF Bay Area,1,"January 17, 2021","Let me get the serious bit out of the way first:  These are awful.  I mean, seriously, horribly, terribly bad in every way. Imagine you took some cardboard, stepped on it, left it out in the rain for 42 days, stuck it in your blender, made ""peanut butter cups"" from it by sprinkling 2 drops of peanut oil and 1/100th of a teaspoon of cocoa powder on each ""cup.""  Then imagine something even more flavorless and with even more off-putting mouth feel.Yes, after trying to force two pieces of this down, I threw out the box and then chanted a protective spell over my trashbin so that the Devil himself would not become reconstituted in my home, bringing about the end of the world as we know it.  HA!  Who am I kidding?  I bet this would give even the Devil uncomfortable stomach rumblings and cause him to run fleeing towards the nearest 7-Eleven to cleanse his palate.Okay, with that out of the way, let me list what I'd rather do than eat another one of these:- Sriracha sauce... in my eyes.- Talk therapy with my best friend's evil mother in law.- Baby Shark song blasted into my ears 24/7You've been warned.Oh, almost forgot!  What's the silver lining?!- Eating one of these may cause you to lose your appetite and thus -- at least temporarily -- eat less.- You can use this product as a VERY powerful threat with your kids.  ""If you don't eat all your veggies, I'll serve you two of the SlimFast cardboard torture pieces for breakfast""- Want your dinner guests to go home (pre/post-COVID) but aren't brave enough to ask them to leave?  Serve them this. They'll suddenly remember they have to go home to floss their cat or check that they didn't leave the iron on, etc.- Secretly hate your colleagues?
